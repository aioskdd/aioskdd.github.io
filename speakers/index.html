            <br>
            <font size="2">Increasingly, leaders across all sectors as well as researchers across all disciplines are appreciating the fact that effective functioning in their work requires a principled adaptive leadership and approach in which their decisions, words and actions are highly trusted by the public. Trust is critical for problem solving because a baseline level of trust is foundational for people to believe the leaders or researchers and decide to cooperate or be motivated to perform actions towards achieving the intended outcome. Leaders and researchers, be they in governments, academia, businesses or non-profit organizations, will find it extremely difficult to implement a measure or an initiative, change a prior decision or explain the change, and galvanize people to collectively manage a crisis or deal with a challenge when public trust is low. Unfortunately, regardless of country or organization, significant gaps and disconnects often exist when it comes to public trust. For example, research in behavioural sciences has consistently shown that trust is difficult to build, easily eroded, and once lost is difficult to restore. In addition, leaders and researchers are susceptible to the same human biases of overconfidence and low self-awareness. This talk will first examine how and why public trust matters. It will then explain how an evidence-based approach to building trust that understands how humans think, feel and act in the contexts of the issues that people care about can help us prevent trust erosion, repair trust violation and enhance trust development.<br>

            <br>
            <font size="2">Asynchronous consensus is the most robust (assuming least trust on underlying network conditions) consensus protocol, thus critical for blockchains deployed over the open Internet. Unfortunately, all existing protocols suffer from low efficiency and essentially none has been widely deployed. In this talk, we will give an overview of a sequence of our recent results on making asynchronous permissioned consensus really fast, and finally, from paper to practice.<br>

From 2016.8 - 2021.1, he was an assistant professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Director of JD-NJIT-ISCAS Joint Blockchain Lab. Before that, he was a postdoc at Cornell IC3. His research span broadly in cryptography and blockchain technology, and his work mostly appeared at flagship venues of security/crypto/distributed computing. He is a recipient of “MIT Technical Review” 35 Chinese Innovators under 35, 2019; a Google Faculty Award; NJIT Research Award 2020, and more.<br>

            <font size="2">This talk presents a decentralized netting protocol that guarantees the privacy of the participants. Namely, it leverages the blockchain and its security properties to relax the trust assumptions and get rid of trusted central parties. We have also proved the protocol to be optimal and analyzed its performance using a proof-of-concept implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric.<br>

            <br>
            <font size="2">Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables multiple organizations to collaboratively build a machine learning model without revealing their raw data to each other. However, there are still two main challenges. One challenge is that many works have shown that sharing even only intermediate information may leak parties’ data privacy. The other is that interpreting the predictions is not straightforward as each party’s data needs to be kept private. In this talk, I will first present our recent work on privacy-preserving vertical FL, ensuring that no intermediate information is disclosed, and is efficient for the privacy achieved. Next, I will discuss how to securely calculate the model interpretability such that the predictions are reliable. Finally, I will talk about the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP) we are working on and speculate on future research directions, such as integrating blockchain technology into FL to make data collaboration more trustful.<br>

His research focuses on federated learning and data privacy and security. From 2019 to 2021, he was a research fellow in Database Systems Research Group, under the supervision of Beng Chin Ooi and Xiaokui Xiao. He obtained his PhD degree in Computer Science from Renmin University of China in 2018, supervised by Hong Chen. He was a visiting student at Simon Fraser University, advised by Ke Wang. He also worked as a senior development engineer at Ant Financial.<br>
